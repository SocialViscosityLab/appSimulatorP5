/** ECMA5 has a crazy way of handling reference to objects instantiated via a constructor. 
 * I discovered that when you call THIS within the scope of the class code, it not always 
 * refers to the instance itself but to relative scopes within the functions inside the class
 * definition. Let's look at this case: in this class, the function setup() enables a watchPosition()
 * function with three callbacks. The callback functions belong to the class, so I need to 
 * refer them using THIS. But the success function is expecting only one value: an object with the
 * coordinates result of the GPS reading. If I want to assign that object to the instance variable THIS.pos
 * it turns out that THIS is undefined within the domain of the success function. So I need to pass the 
 * actual instance as a parameter of the callback using BIND.
 * 
 * The craziest part is that the instance is not
 * passed as a reference to itself but as a 'independent variable'. That is why within the scope of
 * setup there is a variable OBJ. That is a placeholder for the instance. How is the placeholder linked
 * to the instance? I DO NOT KNOW. More info here: https://www.jstips.co/en/javascript/passing-arguments-to-callback-functions/
 * // from https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Geolocation_API/Using_the_Geolocation_API
